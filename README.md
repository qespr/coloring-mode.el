# ascii-picture-coloring-mode

GNU/Emacs mode for coloring ASCII art. 

## Goals

- [ ] Ability to export to ANSI colored text file
- [ ] Support for 16 colors
- [ ] Support for 256 colors
- [ ] Support for even more colors
- [ ] Eventually turn this into fork of artist-mode or picture-mode
- [ ] Maybe get on Melpa

## Disclaimer

I don't know how to write Emacs modes like, at all.
